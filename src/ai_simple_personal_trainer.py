Module implementing a simple AI Personal Trainer using Ollama invocations

Takes in three images of a person (front, side, and back), and generates, based on which areas need improvement, a set of exercises to be added to an existing workout plan

Do not start any exercise program without first consulting with a doctor.  AI-based systems can make mistakes.

Images should always be smaller than 1024 x 1024

Images for front, side, and back should be placed at: image_front.jpeg, image_side.jpeg, image_back.jpeg respectively

Ollama AI needs to be running locally during execution

Ollama AI needs to have the llava and gpt-oss:20b models loaded

Algorithm influenced generally by Agentic AI patterns

Uses some example code from:   https://markaicode.com/process-images-ollama-multimodal-ai/
